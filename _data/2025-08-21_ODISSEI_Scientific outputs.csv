The project will include metadata of (a) all datasets of Statistics Netherlands, including the metadata of the microdata catalogue, (b) all datasets developed supported by ODISSEI in the Netherlands (EVS, GGP, SHARE, ESS, NTR, HSN, LISS) which predominantly apply DDI standards. The project will also develop a metadata ingestion pipeline to make sure that the Portal can be maintained and kept up to date. This pipeline will be used by the hosting party to add new datasets during and after the end of the project. Currently, existing tools for findability in the social sciences are limited in that they only identify specific terms or synonyms (e.g. United Kingdom question bank or the Question Variable Database). The ODISSEI Portal will extend and improve search functionality by using semantic queries which will enable broader probabilistic matching and link functions over an enriched knowledge graph representation of the FAIR metadata catalogue. This incorporates the context of specific terms which are crucial in social research. By using rich and extensible data structures developed within the linked data community, ODISSEI will evolve the relatively flat metadata catalogues in use today into the highly interlinked and graph-based structures needed to conduct advanced semantic searches.","2020-12-01","2021-12-02 15:00:21","2022-11-17 09:54:18","","","","","","","","The ODISSEI Portal","","","","","","","","","","","","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)","","","","","","Roadmap 2020 (Portal)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, the Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations (ODISSEI) consortium has supported the development of the ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer (OSSC) platform that allows researchers to link cohort data to data from Statistics Netherlands and run large-scale analyses in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. Here, we report a successful record linkage genomewide association (GWA) study on expenditure for total health, mental health, primary and hospital care, and medication. Record linkage for genotype data from 16,726 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) with data from Statistics Netherlands was accomplished in the secure OSSC platform, followed by gene-based tests and estimation of total and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability. The total heritability of expenditure ranged between 29.4% (SE 0.8) and 37.5% (SE 0.8), but GWA analyses did not identify SNPs or genes that were genomewide significantly associated with health care expenditure. SNP-based heritability was between 0.0% (SE 3.5) and 5.4% (SE 4.0) and was different from zero for mental health care and primary care expenditure. We conclude that successfully linking genotype data to administrative health care expenditure data from Statistics Netherlands is feasible and demonstrates a series of analyses on health care expenditure. The OSSC platform offers secure possibilities for analyzing linked data in large scale and realizing sample sizes required for GWA studies, providing invaluable opportunities to answer many new research questions.","2021","2021-12-02 15:00:27","2022-11-21 15:09:44","","103-109","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","","","Bridge (OSSC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying problem that motivated this thesis is that many empirical studies use predefined administrative units, and this does not often align with the underlying theory or geography. Despite the extensive literature on neighbourhood effects and, more generally, on sociospatial inequalities, spatial scale remains an under-analysed concept. As a response to this research gap, this thesis takes a multiscale approach to both theory and empirical analysis of neighbourhood effects, highlighting the multitude of spatial processes that may affect individual outcomes of people. To operationalise this, we created bespoke areas (centred around each location) at a range of one hundred scales representing people’s residential contexts, primarily in the Netherlands but also in multiple European capitals. Using microgeographic data and a large number of scales combined with small distance increments revealed subtle changes in sociodemographic characteristics across space. In doing so, we provided new insights into ethnic segregation, potential exposures to poverty, and neighbourhood effects on income, all in light of the fundamental issue of spatial scale: The analyses of sociospatial inequalities are substantially affected by the scale used to operationalise spatial context, and this varies within and between cities and urban regions. The aim of this thesis was therefore not to find a single, ‘true’ scale of neighbourhood, but to acknowledge, operationalise, and better understand the multiplicity of spatial scales.","2020-09-15","2021-12-02 15:00:27","2022-11-17 10:38:09","2021-11-25 09:25:09","","","","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 Ana Petrović","","","","journals.open.tudelft.nl","","Number: 15","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\L8KI34QI\Petrović - 2020 - Multiscale spatial contexts and neighbourhood effe.pdf","","Bridge (OSSC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use genetics (GWAS-by-subtraction) to assess a latent, broad non-cognitive skills dimension. To index parental effects controlling for genetic transmission, we estimate indirect parental genetic effects of polygenic scores on childhood and adulthood educational outcomes, using siblings (N=47,459), adoptees (N=6,407), and parent-offspring trios (N=2,534) in three UK and Dutch cohorts. We find that parental cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect offspring education through their environment: on average across cohorts and designs, indirect genetic effects explain 36-40% of population polygenic score associations. However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating. Our phenotype-agnostic, genetically sensitive approach has established overall environmental effects of parents’ skills, facilitating future mechanistic work.","2021","2021-12-02 15:00:31","2022-11-17 11:00:14","2021-11-11 16:19:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","preprint","bioRxiv","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.09.15.296236","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\2U9VXLGX\Demange et al. - 2020 - Estimating effects of parents’ cognitive and non-c.pdf","","Core (MAG 2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using longitudinal Dutch register data with complete 15-year residential address histories, we examined whether health effects of neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics differ between cumulative and current exposures. We illustrated these differences between exposure assessments using suicide mortality among middle-aged adults. All suicides aged 40–64 years between 2012 and 2016 were matched with 10 random controls in a nested case-control design. We measured neighbourhood exposures longitudinally for circular buffers around residential addresses at the current address and through three accumulative measures, each incorporating the residential address history with increasing detail. Covariate-adjusted conditional logistic regressions were used to assess associations between suicide and neighbourhood social fragmentation, population density and unemployment rate. Our results showed that total and male suicide mortality was significantly lower in highly fragmented neighbourhoods when using accumulative exposures, but not when using the current residential address. However, we observed few differences in coefficients between exposures assessments for neighbourhood urbanicity and unemployment rate. None of the neighbourhood characteristics showed evidence that detailed cumulative exposures were a stronger predictor of suicide compared to more crude measures.

However, the few existing studies used satellite-based measures of radiances for outdoor ALAN exposure assessments, which were possibly confounded by traffic-related air pollutants. Objectives: To assess 1) whether living in areas with increased exposure to outdoor ALAN is associated with depressive symptoms; and 2) to assess the potential confounding effects of air pollution. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from people (N = 10,482) aged 18–65 years in the Netherlands. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ–9). Satellite-measured annual ALAN were taken from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. ALAN exposures were assessed at people's home address within 100 and 600 m buffers. We used generalized (geo)additive models to quantify associations between PHQ–9 scores and quintiles of ALAN adjusting for several potential confounders including PM2.5 and NO2. Results: Unadjusted estimates for the 100 m buffers showed that people in the 2nd to 5th ALAN quintile showed significantly higher PHQ–9 scores than those in the lowest ALAN quintile (βQ2 = 0.503 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.207–0.798], βQ3 = 0.587 [95% CI: 0.291–0.884], βQ4 = 0.921 [95% CI: 0.623–1.218], βQ5 = 1.322 [95% CI: 1.023–1.620]). ALAN risk estimates adjusted for individual and area-level confounders (i.e., PM2.5, urbanicity, noise, land-use diversity, greenness, deprivation, and social fragmentation) were attenuated but remained significant for the 100 m buffer (βQ2 = 0.420 [95% CI: 0.125–0.715], βQ3 = 0.383 [95% CI: 0.071–0.696], βQ4 = 0.513 [95% CI: 0.177–0.850], βQ5 = 0.541 [95% CI: 0.141–0.941]). When adjusting for NO2 per 100 m buffers, the air pollutant was associated with PHQ–9 scores, but ALAN did not display an exposure-response relationship. ALAN associations were insignificant for 600 m buffers. Conclusion: Accounting for NO2 exposure suggested that air pollution rather than outdoor ALAN correlated with depressive symptoms. Future evaluations of health effects from ALAN should consider potential confounding by traffic-related exposures (i.e., NO2).","2020-11-20","2021-12-02 15:00:35","2022-11-21 15:09:54","2021-11-11 16:12:40","140914","","","744","","Science of The Total Environment","Outdoor light at night, air pollution and depressive symptoms","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","24 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\SFQA8DG2\Helbich et al. - 2020 - Outdoor light at night, air pollution and depressi.pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","Mental health; Air pollution; Artificial light at night; Depression; Deprivation; Environmental risk factors; Green space; Noise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous literature has imputed consumption with administrative data using the household budget constraint. We introduce an alternative approach where expenditure surveys are supplemented with information from unlinkable administrative data using overlapping variables. We compare the two imputation methods by exploiting a Dutch expenditure survey that is linkable to administrative data and apply both methods to study household consumption behaviour. We present evidence for heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume out of income and housing wealth due to the eﬀects of low cash-on-hand, negative housing equity and mandatory pension fund participation.

We find that the urban wage premium is higher for workers performing non-routine tasks, particularly analytic tasks, while it is absent for workers in routine task intensive jobs. These findings also hold within skill groups and suggest that routinisation increases spatial wage and skill inequality within urban areas.

Economic sanctions are a vitally important element of the European Union's foreign policy toolbox. While their importance and frequency of use increased, not much is known about the economic impact of the economic sanctions at the micro level. Yet the sanctions imposition has been recently politicized within the EU, especially in the reaction to the sanctions that EU imposed on Russia, and the counter - sanctions that ensued. Drawing on export data for all Dutch companies over the period 2013 –2016, we examine how Dutch companies responded to Russian counter -sanctions imposed on the EU after the annexation of Crimea. Our statistical matching approach suggests that while the companies exposed to the sanctions are more likely to go bankrupt compared to their unexposed counterparts, those who survive are able to weather the impact rather well in the medium -long term.","2021","2021-12-02 15:00:35","2022-11-21 15:10:36","2021-11-15 11:22:55","1-19","","n/a","n/a","","","No More Gouda in Moscow?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jcms.13185","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\L7GIGARI\Onderco and van der Veer - No More Gouda in Moscow Distributive Effects of t.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\6Y4W7FWR\jcms.html","","Core (MAD 2019)","European Union; firms; Russia; sanctions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated 1) the associations between multiple environmental exposures and depressive symptoms, both in the residential environment and along the daily mobility path, 2) examined differences in the strength of associations between residential- and mobility-based models, and 3) explored sex as a moderator. Depressive symptoms of 393 randomly sampled adults aged 18–65 were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Respondents were tracked via global positioning systems- (GPS) enabled smartphones for up to 7 days. Exposure to green space (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), blue space, noise (Lden) and air pollution (particulate matter (PM2.5)) within 50 m and 100 m of each residential address and GPS point was computed. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted separately for the residential- and mobility-based exposures. Wald tests were used to assess if the coefficients differed across models. Interaction terms were entered in fully adjusted models to determine if associations varied by sex. A significant negative relationship between green space and depressive symptoms was found in the fully adjusted residential- and mobility-based models using the 50 m buffer. No significant differences were observed in coefficients across models. None of the interaction terms were significant. Our results suggest that exposure to green space in the immediate environment, both at home and along the daily mobility path, is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Further research is required to establish the utility of dynamic approaches to exposure assessment in studies on the environment and mental health.","2021-11-01","2021-12-02 15:00:35","2022-11-21 15:10:57","2021-11-11 16:14:18","106635","","","156","","Environment International","Multiple environmental exposures along daily mobility paths and depressive symptoms","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","15 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\H8K7AA8L\Roberts and Helbich - 2021 - Multiple environmental exposures along daily mobil.pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","Mental health; Depression; Environmental exposures; Global positioning systems; Mobility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether the system reaches its goal depends not only on whether eligible individuals have equal access to care but also on whether entitlements for care reflect needs, irrespective of socioeconomic status and other characteristics. We assess and decompose total inequity into inequity in (i) entitlements for home care and (ii) the conversion of these entitlements into actual use. This distinction is original and important, because inequity calls for different policy responses depending on the stage at which it arises. Linking survey and administrative data on the 65 and older, we find higher income elderly to receive less home care than poorer elderly with similar needs. Although lower income elderly tend to make greater use of their entitlements, need-standardized entitlements are similar across income, education, and wealth levels. However, both use and entitlements vary by origin and place of residence. The Dutch need assessment seems effective at restricting socioeconomic inequity in home care use but may not fully prevent inequity along other dimensions. Low financial barriers and universal eligibility rules may help achieve equity in access but are not sufficient conditions.","2020","2021-12-02 15:00:35","2022-11-21 15:12:13","2021-11-11 16:16:47","1161-1179","","10","29","","","Eligibility or use?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","5 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hec.4126","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\MHXAWH54\Tenand et al. - 2020 - Eligibility or use Disentangling the sources of h.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\6STCP8EZ\hec.html","","Core (MAD 2019)","eligibility; equity in care use; home care; horizontal equity; needs assessment; socioeconomic inequality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AimTo investigate how recreational walking and transportation walking are associated with the natural and built environmental characteristics of the living environment in the Netherlands, and examine the differences in their associations between weekdays and weekends. Method and data We extracted the total duration of daily walking (in minutes per person) for recreation and transportation of adults aged 18 years and above from the Dutch National Travel Survey 2015–2017 (N = 65,785) and analyzed it as an outcome variable. Objective measures of the natural (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), blue space and meteorological conditions) and built environment (i.e., crossing density, land-use mix, and residential building density) around respondents' home addresses were determined for buffers with 300, 600, and 1000 m radii using a geographic information system. To assess associations between recreational and transportation walking and the environmental exposures separately, we fitted Tobit regression models to the walking data, adjusted for multiple confounders. ResultsOn weekdays, people living in areas with less NDVI, higher land-use mix, and higher crossing density were more likely to engage in transportation walking. Recreational walking was negatively associated with NDVI, blue space, crossing density, precipitation and daily average temperature. At weekends, land-use mix supports both recreational and transportation walking. A negative association appeared for NDVI and transportation walking. Daily average rainfall and temperature were inversely correlated with recreational walking. Sensitivity tests indicated that some associations depend on the buffer size. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the built and natural environments are differently associated with people's recreational and transportation walking. We also found differences in the walking-environment associations between weekdays and weekends. Place-based policies to design walking-friendly neighborhoods may have different implications for different types of walking.","2021-03-01","2021-12-02 15:00:35","2022-11-21 15:12:44","2021-11-11 16:15:59","110591","","","194","","Environmental Research","Objective environmental exposures correlate differently with recreational and transportation walking","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","5 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\PQGVU4LW\Wang et al. - 2021 - Objective environmental exposures correlate differ.pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","Built and natural environments; Exposure; Recreational walking; The Netherlands; Transportation walking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use longitudinal panel data from the LISS panel, collected in April, June and November 2020, to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relative distribution of care by mothers and fathers in the Netherlands.

First results from the LISS Panel.","","","","","https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hf32q/","The outbreak of the Corona virus has led to unprecedented measures in education.  From March 16, all schools in the Netherlands are closed, and children must keep up with their schoolwork from home. Parents are expected to take a crucial role in this “homeschooling”: they are primarily responsible for ensuring that their children follow the curriculum. In this article I report the first results of a module in the LISS Panel that was designed to map how parents school their children in primary and secondary education. Data on a nationally representative sample of 1,318 children in primary and secondary education were gathered in April. The results show marked differences between social groups. Whereas all parents find it important that their children keep up with the schoolwork, children from advantaged backgrounds receive much more parental support and have more resources (e.g., own computer) to study from home. Differences in parental support are driven by the ability to help: parents with a higher education degree feels themselves much capable to help their children with schoolwork than lower educated parents. Parents also report that schools provide more extensive distant schooling for children in the academic track in secondary education (vwo) than for children in the pre-vocational track (vmbo). Finally, there is a clear gender gap: parents feel much more capable to support their daughters than their sons.	These initial findings provide clear indications that the school shutdown in the Netherlands is likely to have strong effects on the inequality in educational opportunities.","2020-04-30","2021-12-02 15:00:40","2022-11-17 10:18:29","2021-11-25 12:45:27","","","","","","","","","","","","SocArXiv","","en-us","","","","","OSF Preprints","","DOI: 10.31235/osf.io/hf32q type: article","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\XPXE234I\Bol - 2020 - Inequality in homeschooling during the Corona cris.pdf","","Core (LISS 2020 Corona)","Social and Behavioral Sciences; Sociology; Poverty; and Mobility; corona; covid-19; Economics; education; Education; homeschooling; inequality; Inequality; netherlands; Online and Distance Education; opportunity; Secondary Education; Sociology of Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study the Netherlands, a less likely case to find political intolerance. Using data from a representative household panel survey (n = 1999), we investigate the extent to which populist attitudes translate into general intolerant attitudes and specific intolerance toward political antagonists. Our analyses show that voters with stronger populist attitudes are less supportive of democratic norms, more intolerant of opposing views online, and of specific political opponents. However, they are not explicitly intolerant by limiting individual civil rights or supporting intolerant measures toward political antagonists.

Data were analyzed using a cross-lagged panel model, which allows to test for prospective effects of one variable on the other, while controlling for autoregressive effects. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, results showed that financial scarcity was positively related with an increase in subsequent financial avoidance, whereas financial avoidance was positively related with an increase in subsequent financial scarcity.

The generalizability of these findings may be limited, due to China’s one-child policy and socioeconomic policies which may have led to fewer differences in wealth.

This can lead to worse decision outcomes and appearance-based discrimination. What explains this overreliance on facial impressions? In three studies, we examine the role of lay beliefs in physiognomy—the idea that facial features are indicative of a person’s character. We find widespread endorsement of physiognomic beliefs in a representative sample of the Dutch population (Study 1, n = 2,624). Crucially, people with stronger physiognomic belief rely more on facial impressions when making trust decisions (Study 2, n = 224). They are also more confident in their ability to detect corrupt politicians based on facial photographs, but this increased confidence is not associated with superior judgment accuracy (Study 3, n = 406).

Government measures in response to the pandemic strongly restricted informal caregivers in providing help and care to persons with health-related needs. At the same time, formal care was scaled back and informal caregivers' urge to help their loved ones was likely higher than before the pandemic. Generally, women pick up a larger share of informal care and experience more caregiver burden. We assessed whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the gender gaps in informal caregiving by analyzing unique data on Dutch informal caregivers (N = 1672 caregiving situations in 1196 respondents). Results showed that women, compared to men, were more likely to have stopped and reduced caregiving, but also to have cared more during the pandemic. Moreover, based on longitudinally comparing levels during and before the lockdown, we found that the gender gap in caregiver burden narrowed down, especially because burden decreased for women. This means that the caregiver burden was more equally distributed among women and men during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 lockdown than before.","2021","2021-12-02 15:00:40","2022-11-21 12:29:22","2021-11-11 16:13:08","1926-1936","","5","28","","","Are the gender gaps in informal caregiving intensity and burden closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","7 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gwao.12725","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\KD5WA36V\Raiber and Verbakel - 2021 - Are the gender gaps in informal caregiving intensi.pdf","","Core (LISS 2019)","caregiver burden; COVID-19; gender inequality; informal care; intensity of informal care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed the national nostalgia component of PRRP ideology with respect to voters. Relying on political science theorizing and social psychological evidence, we proposed that national nostalgia forms a new emotion-based explanation for PRRP support within the cultural grievance framework. National nostalgia reflects grievances over perceived loss of the ethnically and culturally homogeneous moral community. Such grievances are subsequently mobilized by PRRP to justify and increase the persuasiveness of their nativist ideology. We hypothesized that voters who experience higher national nostalgia would evince stronger support for PRRP, due to national nostalgia's association with endorsement of PRRP's nativist ideology (i.e., ethnic nationhood and anti-Muslim attitudes). We tested this hypothesis by surveying a representative sample of native majority members in The Netherlands (N = 1,934).

Methods For this prospective study, the April 2020 Online Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Panel Wave was used. Of the 3117 Longitudinal Internet Studies For The Social Sciences panel members contacted, 2411 completed the full questionnaire (77.4% response rate), after combining data from earlier waves, the final sample size was 1909. A total of 3 scales focusing on trust in the implementation of AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology were used. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance was used for comparison. Results The overall means show that respondents have slightly more trust in AI in dermatology than in radiology and surgery. The means show that higher educated males, employed or student, of Western background, and those not admitted to a hospital in the past 12 months have more trust in AI. The trust in AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology is positively associated with belief in the efficiency of AI and these specific domains were negatively associated with distrust and accountability in AI in general. Conclusions The general population is more distrustful of AI in medicine unlike the overall optimistic views posed in the media. The level of trust is dependent on what medical area is subject to scrutiny. Certain demographic characteristics and individuals with a generally positive view on AI and its efficiency are significantly associated with higher levels of trust in AI.","2021-10-13","2021-12-02 15:00:40","2022-11-21 15:12:49","2021-11-22 15:52:48","","","","","","Value in Health","Do People Favor Artificial Intelligence Over Physicians?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","6 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\89NSZP6A\Yakar et al. - 2021 - Do People Favor Artificial Intelligence Over Physi.pdf","","Core (LISS 2019)","and questionnaires; artificial intelligence; general population; medicine; surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. Method We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. Results Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. Conclusion In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. Discussion The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality.","2020-11-30","2021-12-02 15:00:40","2022-11-21 15:12:52","2021-11-11 16:00:21","e0242249","","11","15","","PLOS ONE","‘Intelligent’ lockdown, intelligent effects?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","64 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\SQG4PC5D\Yerkes et al. - 2020 - ‘Intelligent’ lockdown, intelligent effects Resul.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\9MKAH4EX\article.html","","Core (LISS 2020 Corona)","Children; COVID 19; Mothers; Pandemics; Professions; Quality of life; Schools; Sexual and gender issues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An alternative hypothesis is that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas.To assess whether adults with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia have an increased probability to live in more populated areas than those with lower risk.Four large, cross-sectional samples of genotyped individuals of European ancestry older than 18 years with known addresses in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands were included in the analysis. Data were based on the postcode of residence at the time of last contact with the participants. Community-based samples who took part in studies conducted by the Queensland Institute for Medical Research Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR), UK Biobank (UKB), Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), or QSkin Sun and Health Study (QSKIN) were included. Genome-wide association analysis and mendelian randomization (MR) were included. The study was conducted between 2016 and 2018.Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia derived from genetic data (genetic risk is independently measured from the occurrence of the disease). Socioeconomic status of the area was included as a moderator in some of the models.Population density of the place of residence of the participants determined from census data. Remoteness and socioeconomic status of the area were also tested.The QIMR participants (15 544; 10 197 [65.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 54.4 [13.2] years) living in more densely populated areas (people per square kilometer) had a higher genetic loading for schizophrenia (r2 = 0.12%; P = 5.69 × 10−5), a result that was replicated across all 3 other cohorts (UKB: 345 246; 187 469 [54.3%] women; age, 65.7 [8.0] years; NTR: 11 212; 6727 [60.0%] women; age, 48.6 [17.5] years; and QSKIN: 15 726; 8602 [54.7%] women; age, 57.0 [7.9] years). This genetic association could account for 1.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.2%) of the schizophrenia risk. Estimates from MR analyses performed in the UKB sample were significant (b = 0.049; P = 3.7 × 10−7 using GSMR), suggesting that the genetic liability to schizophrenia may have a causal association with the tendency to live in urbanized locations.The results of this study appear to support the hypothesis that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas and suggest the need to refine the social stress model for schizophrenia by including genetics as well as possible gene-environment interactions.","2018-09-01","2021-12-02 15:01:08","2022-11-21 15:09:41","2021-11-22 16:32:47","901-910","","9","75","","JAMA Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","46 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\LA7YJ5R2\Colodro-Conde et al. - 2018 - Association Between Population Density and Genetic.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\QENMTGS3\2685919.html","","Core (NTR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed 1) to compare associations between remotely sensed and street view (SV) greenness, and 2) to examine whether these greenness metrics are differently associated with mental health outcomes. We used cross-sectional depressive and anxiety symptoms data on adults in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We employed a convolutional neural network to segment greenness in SV panoramas. Greenness was measured top-down by normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from 1 m resolution orthophotos (OP) and 30 m resolution Landsat-8 (LS) imagery per postal code, and 100 and 300 m concentric and street-network buffers at the home address. Correlation analyses assessed associations across greenness measures. Covariate-adjusted regressions (e.g., noise, air pollution, deprivation) were conducted to assess associations between each greenness metric and mental health outcomes. Correlations between greenness metrics were significantly positive and moderately high. SV greenness was less sensitive across scales and residential contexts than OP and LS greenness. There was no statistically significant evidence that people with less urban residential greenness had higher depression or anxiety scores than those exposed to higher levels. Nor did different greenness measures, scales, or residential context definitions alter our null associations. This suggests that even though SV and remotely sensed measures capture different aspects of greenness, these differences across exposure metrics did not translate into an association with mental health outcomes.","2021-10-01","2021-12-02 15:01:08","2022-11-21 15:10:13","2021-11-11 16:16:10","104181","","","214","","Landscape and Urban Planning","Can’t see the wood for the trees?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","11 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\E6ZZE84K\Helbich et al. - 2021 - Can’t see the wood for the trees An assessment of.pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","Depression; Green space; Anxiety; Computer vision; Deep learning; Street view imagery; Uncertain geographic context","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TMV5PBJ7","manuscript","2021","Kastelein, Pim","Wealth and consumption over the life cycle with pension plans and durable goods","","","","","","Households allocate large portions of their income to illiquid durable goods and pension plans. Governments often subsidise or mandate participation in the latter to ensure adequate retirement saving. This comes at the expense of decreased resilience to adverse shocks and distorted accumulation of durables during working life. We construct a life-cycle model with pensions and durables to study the eﬀects of diﬀerent pension plan designs. Contributions are irreversible until retirement and non-collateralisable, while purchasing durables is subject to adjustment costs and borrowing constraints. Despite this illiquidity, households keep little precautionary savings because of utility from durables and longevity insurance from pension plans. We calibrate the model to the pension system of the Netherlands where households face a rigid contribution mandate. Our model replicates the illiquid ﬁnancial portfolios of Dutch households and indicates that ﬂexibilisation policies (such as voluntary participation, richer contribution mandates and early withdrawal) improve household liquidity and welfare.","2021","2022-02-16 12:58:41","2022-11-24 08:12:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\KYL5DWEG\Kastelein - Wealth and consumption over the life cycle with pe.pdf","","Core (MAD 2019)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiscale measures of population have been developed in the segregation and neighborhood effects literatures, which have acknowledged the role of a variety of spatial contexts for individual outcomes and intergroup contacts. Although existing studies dealing with sociospatial inequalities increasingly explore the effects of spatial scale, there has been little systematic evidence on how exposure to sociospatial contexts changes across urban space, both within and between cities. This article presents a multiscale approach to measuring potential exposure to others. Using individual-level register data for the full population of The Netherlands and an exceptionally detailed multiscalar framework of bespoke neighborhoods at 101 spatial scales, we measured the share of non-Western ethnic minorities for three Dutch cities with different urban forms. We created individual and cumulative distance profiles of ethnic exposure, mapped ethnic exposure surfaces, and applied entropy as a measure of scalar variation to compare potential exposure to others in different locations both within and between cities. The multiscale approach can be implemented for examining a variety of social processes, notably segregation and neighborhood effects.","2018-07-04","2022-02-22 10:45:42","2022-11-21 15:10:43","2022-02-22 10:45:42","1057-1074","","4","108","","","Multiscale Measures of Population","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","23 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2017.1411245","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\RDCY4B7A\Petrović et al. - 2018 - Multiscale Measures of Population Within- and bet.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\QRN7AID2\24694452.2017.html","","Bridge (OSSC)","distance profile, entropy, ethnic exposure, spatial scale, urban form; perfil de distancia, entropía, exposición étnica, escala espacial, forma urbana; 距离概况, 熵, 族裔暴露, 空间尺度, 城市形态。","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are also challenged to understand the nuanced ways in which the first lockdown affects the combination of paid work and care. We address both of these issues, providing a cross-sectional comparative analysis of highly educated mothers’ perceptions of work–life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland and the Netherlands. Our findings show that highly educated Finnish mothers have more difficulty combining work and care during the first lockdown than Dutch mothers. The absence of state-provided care during the lockdown creates greater difficulty for full-time working Finnish mothers in a dual-earner/state-carer system than an absence of such care in the Dutch one-and-a-half earner system, where most mothers work part time. Further analyses suggest variation in part-time and (nearly) full-time hours mitigates the work–life balance experiences of highly educated Dutch mothers.

The Informal Care Model developed by Broese van Groenou and de Boer (Eur J Ageing 13(3):271–279, 2016) provides a theoretical foundation to understand under what conditions a person provides informal care. We test this theoretical model by applying it to intrapersonal changes in informal care provision during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands in Spring 2020. Data from the LISS panel from two time points, March 2020 and data from July over the period of April/May 2020, were analysed with multinominal multilevel regression analysis (N = 1270 care situations of 1014 caregivers). Our results showed that the individual determinants (Do I have to?, Do I want to?, and especially Can I?) discussed in the Informal Care Model (apart from a series of control variables) are contributing substantially to the understanding of intrapersonal changes in care provision during the first lockdown and by that, we found empirical support for the theoretical model.

DP-CGANS distinguishes categorical and continuous variables and transforms them to latent space separately. Then, we structure a conditional vector as an additional input to not only presents the minority class in the imbalanced data, but also capture the dependency between variables. We inject statistical noise to the gradients in the networking training process of DP-CGANS to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively evaluate our model with state-of-the-art generative models on three public datasets and two real-world personal health datasets in terms of statistical similarity, machine learning performance, and privacy measurement. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other comparable models, especially in capturing dependency between variables.

While the FAIR Guiding Principles have been introduced to help researchers to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, it is still unclear how the notions of FAIR and Openness can be applied in the context of restricted data. Many methods have been proposed in support of the implementation of the principles, but there is yet no consensus among the scientific community as to the suitable mechanisms of making restricted data FAIR. We present here a systematic literature review to identify the methods applied by scientists when researching restricted data in a FAIR-compliant manner in the context of the FAIR principles. Through the employment of a descriptive and iterative study design, we aim to answer the following three questions: (1) What methods have been proposed to apply the FAIR principles to restricted data?, (2) How can the relevant aspects of the methods proposed be categorized?, (3) What is the maturity of the methods proposed in applying the FAIR principles to restricted data?. After analysis of the 40 included publications, we noticed that the methods found, reflect the stages of the Data Life Cycle, and can be divided into the following Classes: Data Collection, Metadata Representation, Data Processing, Anonymization, Data Publication, Data Usage and Post Data Usage. We observed that a large number of publications used ‘Access Control‘ and ‘Usage and License Terms’ methods, while others such as ‘Embargo on Data Release’ and the use of ‘Synthetic Data’ were used in fewer instances.

Each suicide case was matched to ten randomly selected controls. Two blue space exposures were assigned over a ten-year residential address history: distance to the closest inland blue space and distance to the coast. We ﬁtted (gender-stratiﬁed) conditional logistic regressions to the data. Possible effect modiﬁcations by income were also examined. In total, our analyses included 9757 cases and 95,641 controls. Effect estimates for distance to the closest inland blue space in the total population showed that people living farthest away from inland blue space were at-risk. Suicide risk was lower among women who lived farther away from the coast; no signiﬁcant effect was observed for men. No evidence was observed that income modiﬁed these associations. Our ﬁndings provide suggestive evidence that living close to the coast is associated with greater suicide risk for women, while living closer to inland blue spaces may add to the resilience against suicide in the total population. Past research shows that coastal proximity protects against milder forms of mental illness, but these protective effects do not appear to hold for suicide.

Classically scholars focus on two strategies of informal caregivers to adapt employment: stopping and reducing working hours. Two other, but neglected, plausible strategies may similarly have career consequences, namely changing jobs and becoming self-employed. We first assess the theoretical idea that a work-care conflict is a condition for choosing a work adaption strategy. Second, we theoretically and empirically explore a life course (i.e., timing) and gender perspective on strategies to adapt paid work. We use detailed Dutch retrospective data on informal caregiving, collected within LISS panel (N=3,676 caregiving episodes of 2,114 caregivers). Based on multilevel logistic regression models, we find that caregivers who felt that they had difficulties combining work and care, were more likely to choose any strategy. Especially caregivers who started to provide care at the age of 24 or younger were more likely to reduce working hours or change jobs. In the early family formation stage (25-34 years), women were more likely to reduce working hours, while in early middle age (45-54 years) men were more likely to stop working.","2022-07-12","2022-08-15 07:43:03","2022-11-17 10:25:26","2022-08-15 07:43:03","","","","","","","","","","","","OSF Preprints","","en-us","","","","","OSF Preprints","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\2QJJ5UPP\Raiber et al. - 2022 - Strategies of Informal Caregivers to Adapt Paid Wo.pdf","","Core (LISS 2019)","Social and Behavioral Sciences; Sociology; informal care; and Society; Family; gender; labour force participation; life course; Life Course; work-family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we hypothesized that collective nostalgia for the country's past is triggered by a sense of collective discontinuity and subsequently engenders collective action intentions to protect the national ingroup and limit the presence of immigrant outgroups. We tested this hypothesis in a three-wave longitudinal cross-lagged panel study (N = 1489) among native Dutch majority members. The results were consistent with the hypothesis. The findings highlight the relevance of collective nostalgia as an emotional response to collective discontinuity that drives collective action intentions aimed at protecting ingroup continuity.

However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify potential causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating. Our phenotype-agnostic, genetically sensitive approach has established overall environmental effects of parents’ skills, facilitating future mechanistic work.","2022-08-23","2022-08-23 15:07:48","2022-11-21 15:09:47","2022-08-23 15:07:48","4801","","1","13","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","2 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21] Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\MT5C425T\Demange et al. - 2022 - Estimating effects of parents’ cognitive and non-c.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\5R3BVPCV\s41467-022-32003-x.html","","Bridge (NTR)","Behavioural genetics; Human behaviour; Risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives To examine the associations between suicide mortality and long-term residential greenery exposure in male and female adults. Methods Our population-based nested case-control study used longitudinally georeferenced Dutch register data. Suicide cases aged 18–64 years between 2007 and 2016 were matched by gender, age, and date of suicide to 10 random controls. We measured long-term greenery exposure along people’s 10-year residential address histories through longitudinal normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from Landsat satellite imagery between 1997 and 2016. We assigned accumulated greenery exposures, weighted by people’s exposure duration, within 300, 600, and 1,000 m concentric buffers around home addresses. To assess associations between suicide and greenery, we estimated gender-specific conditional logistic regressions without and with adjustment for individual-level and area-level confounders. Stratified models were fitted for areas with a high/low level of urbanicity and movers/non-movers. Results Our study population consisted of 9,757 suicide cases and 95,641 controls. In our models adjusted for age, gender, and date of suicide, the odds ratios decreased significantly with higher quartiles of accumulated NDVI scores. NDVI associations were attenuated and did not remain significant after adjustment for socioeconomics, urbanicity, air pollution, social fragmentation, etc. for either males or females. For females, but not males, our model with 300 m buffers for areas with a low level of urbanicity showed a significant suicide risk reduction with increasing levels of NDVI. Individual risk factors (e.g., lack of labor market participation) outweighed the contribution of greenery. Conclusion We found limited evidence that long-term greenery exposure over people’s lifetimes contributes to resilience against suicide mortality. Ensuring exposure to greenery may contribute to suicide prevention for specific population groups, but the effectiveness of such exposure should not be overstated.","2020-10-01","2022-11-21 10:44:43","2022-11-21 15:40:07","2022-11-21 10:44:43","105982","","","143","","Environment International","Greenery exposure and suicide mortality later in life","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","22 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\UJNGUA4I\Helbich et al. - 2020 - Greenery exposure and suicide mortality later in l.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\ZB7CJ8YQ\S0160412020319371.html","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","Mental health; Exposure; Life course; Greenery; Longitudinal register data; Residential mobility; Suicide mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a consequence, verdicts are usually reached after a message has started to go viral and interventions can have only limited effect. A new approach inspired by the scholarly debate and implemented in practice is to harness the wisdom of the crowd by enabling recipients of an online message to attach veracity assessments to it, with the intention to allow poor initial crowd reception to temper belief in and further spread of misinformation. We study this approach by letting 4,000 subjects in 80 experimental bipartisan communities sequentially rate the veracity of informational messages. We find that in well-mixed communities, the public display of earlier veracity ratings indeed enhances the correct classification of true and false messages by subsequent users. However, crowd intelligence backfires when false information is sequentially rated in ideologically segregated communities. This happens because early raters’ ideological bias, which is aligned with a message, influences later raters’ assessments away from the truth. These results suggest that network segregation poses an important problem for community misinformation detection systems that must be accounted for in the design of such systems.","2022-08-31","2022-11-21 10:54:31","2022-11-21 10:55:13","2022-11-21 10:54:31","","","","","","","Realtime user ratings as a strategy for combatting misinformation","","","","","","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1967510/v1","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\CSYILJXX\Stein et al. - 2022 - Realtime user ratings as a strategy for combatting.pdf","","Roadmap (MOE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of health outcomes rather than structure and process indicators is considered as the way forward, but outcome-based results risk being biased by selection. Accounting for such selection bias is more difficult in settings with small-sized providers and low chances of resident health improvement, like in the case of nursing homes. In this paper we (i) measure the health outcomes of Dutch nursing homes in terms of mortality and avoidable hospitalizations among residents, (ii) we adopt a novel approach to test for selection bias and (iii) we examine the relationship between outcomes and other nursing home quality indicators and characteristics. Using administrative data from more than 110,000 residents, we estimate the performance of the 849 largest nursing homes in the Netherlands in the period 2015–2019. Controlling for an extensive set of observable case-mix variables, we first test for the presence of selection bias using a distance-based instrumental variable. We do not find any evidence for such a structural bias. While the wide confidence intervals of the estimates display considerable imprecision, our results do reveal substantial differences between top and bottom performing nursing homes. Because the outcome-based estimates turn out to be only weakly correlated with other quality indicators, we conclude that our mortality and avoidable hospitalization-based indicators provide important complementary information. When small sample issues and case-mix differences are adequately accounted for, outcome-based indicators can provide useful policy guidance for quality improvement in nursing homes.","2022-11-01","2022-11-21 11:01:52","2022-11-21 15:09:32","2022-11-21 11:01:52","1-23","","","203","","Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","0 citations (Crossref) [2022-11-21]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\FR2PI4M2\Bär et al. - 2022 - Estimating the health value added by nursing homes.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\T4RPRVYE\S0167268122003092.html","","Core (MAD 2019); Confidence of grant attribution: low","Nursing homes; Administrative data; Health outcomes; Instrumental variable; Performance; Value-added","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study found, quite surprisingly and contrary to what several theories predict, that the expected ethnic gap in job status between the two groups disappeared in the 6 years between 2006 and 2012. Many sub-Saharan Africans successfully transformed their flexible contracts into permanent ones, catching up with the native Dutch by 2012. The analysis of the statutory provisions showed that the workforce numerical composition in the cleaning industry was important for the inclusiveness of sub-Saharan immigrants. This numerical compositional effect was facilitated by the collective agreements negotiated by trade unions, agreements that were extended to temp workers. Sub-Saharan Africans, overrepresented in the cleaning industry, have benefited disproportionally from the settled agreements. We thus conclude that trade unions can improve the inclusion of migrants not only by explicitly focusing on migrant representation but also by targeting sectors with an overrepresentation of migrants.","2022","2022-11-23 09:16:47","2022-11-23 09:18:01","2022-11-23 09:16:47","","","n/a","n/a","","","Flexible labour market and trade unions","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjir.12718","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\ZLNYL876\Confurius et al. - Flexible labour market and trade unions Surprisin.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\84AJEVIF\bjir.html","","Core (MAD 2018)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wages are typically above the marginal revenue contribution of employees. This is not in line with monopsonistic labor markets but precisely what is expected when employees have bargaining power and can extract rents from their employers. In addition, I provide evidence of buyer power in intermediate input markets and show that firms that underpay their input suppliers on the margin set higher wage markups. This suggests that firms share rents generated in intermediate input markets with their employees.

The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether, and if so to what extent, traditional media use during the 2021 Dutch parliamentary elections has (still) affected vote choice in this era of social media. To study this, two-wave panel survey data from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Survey (DPES) are combined with an automated content analysis of newspaper articles (N = 35,511). We created respondent-specific content variables to conduct a linkage analysis. Our analysis, relying on a pooled analysis of respondent–party combinations (N = 54,162), demonstrates that political parties profit electorally from being visible in both newspapers and online outlets. This is in particular true for parties that are not part of parliament yet, thus increasing the further fragmentation and division in Dutch politics.

Alternatively, there can be an amplifying effect, in which case the classroom environment is more important for high-SES children. This would increase educational inequality. We investigate the two alternatives by applying a twin design to data from 4,216 twin pairs from the Netherlands Twin Register (birth cohorts 1991–2002). Some twin pairs share a classroom and other twins from the same pair are in different classrooms. We use this fact to decompose the variance in educational performance at the end of primary school into four components: genetic variance, classroom variance, shared environmental variance, and non-shared environmental variance.

Conventionally, well-being/inequality in housing have been evaluated by measures of economic/material means for housing or satisfaction. In theory, these evaluation approaches overlook some important normative concerns, and applying the capability approach – evaluating the capabilities to reside in ways a person values – can compensate for such weakness. However, its practical difference appears as yet contested. This study reviews the sources of such contesting views, and clarifies them by comparing the capability-oriented and conventional mea­ sures of housing deprivation in terms of their identification of deprived groups that welfare policies are supposed to address. The results showed that the overlap between the deprived groups was rather limited, revealing blind spots in the current welfare policies for housing and the informational benefits of capabilityoriented evaluation.

A new approach recently proposed in scholarship and piloted on online platforms is to harness the wisdom of the crowd by enabling recipients of an online message to attach veracity assessments to it. The intention is to allow poor initial crowd reception to temper belief in and further spread of misinformation. We study this approach by letting 4000 subjects in 80 experimental bipartisan communities sequentially rate the veracity of informational messages. We find that in well-mixed communities, the public display of earlier veracity ratings indeed enhances the correct classification of true and false messages by subsequent users. However, crowd intelligence backfires when false information is sequentially rated in ideologically segregated communities. This happens because early raters’ ideological bias, which is aligned with a message, influences later raters’ assessments away from the truth. These results suggest that network segregation poses an important problem for community misinformation detection systems that must be accounted for in the design of such systems.","2023-01-28","2023-01-30 10:04:55","2023-01-30 10:05:23","2023-01-30 10:04:55","1626","","1","13","","Sci Rep","Realtime user ratings as a strategy for combatting misinformation","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\EMPPJW4R\Stein et al. - 2023 - Realtime user ratings as a strategy for combatting.pdf","","Roadmap (MOE)","Human behaviour; Computational models; Information technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the moderating effects of age and urbanicity on the associations between the neighborhood physical environment and the recreational and transportation walking of adults in the Netherlands. We used data on adults aged ≥ 18 years (N=65,785) taken from the Dutch National Travel Survey for 2015–2017. The outcome variable was the total duration of daily walking separately for recreation and transportation. We assessed the characteristics of the natural and built environments objectively based on respondents' home addresses within 300 m, 600 m, and 1000 m buffers. Tobit regression models with interaction terms between age and the physical environment were fitted. The results showed that age significantly modified the walking-environment associations and the moderating effects differed between weekdays and weekends. We also found that environmental characteristics (like residential density) correlated with walking differently among different age groups across urban and rural areas.

Using novel harmonized data from four countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) and a work-care regime framework, this study examines cross-national changes in fathers’ shares of domestic labour during the early months of the pandemic and whether these changes are associated with parents’ satisfaction with the division of labour. Results indicate that fathers’ shares of housework and childcare increased early in the pandemic in all countries, with fathers’ increased shares of housework being particularly pronounced in the US. Results also show an association between fathers’ increased shares of domestic labour and mothers’ increased satisfaction with the division of domestic labour in the US, Canada, and the UK.

This study estimates the effect of neighbourhood characteristics on mental health while aiming to adjust for this residential self-selection. A two-step method was implemented using register data from Statistics Netherlands from all residents of the city of Rotterdam relocating within the city in 2013 (N=12.456). First, using a conditional logit model, we estimated for each individual the probability of relocating to a neighbourhood over all other neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, based on personal and neighbourhood characteristics in 2013. Second, we corrected for this selection process in a model investigating the effects of neighbourhood characteristics in 2014 on reimbursed anti-depressant/anti-psychotic medication in 2016. Personal and neighbourhood characteristics predicted neighbourhood choice, indicating strong patterns of selection into neighbourhoods. Unadjusted for selection log neighbourhood income was associated with reimbursed medication (β=─0.040,95%CI:─0.060,─0.020), but the association strongly attenuated after controlling for self-selection into neighbourhoods (β=─0.010,95%CI:─0.030,0.011). The opposite was observed for contact with neighbors; unadjusted for self-selection there was no association (β=─0.020, 95%CI:─0.073,0.033), but after adjustment increased neighborhood contact was associated with an 8.5% relative reduction in reimbursed medication (β=-0.075,95%CI:=─0.126,─0.025).

However, policy experiments are not very common. This paper studies whether a lack of appreciation of policy experiments among voters may be the reason for this. Using unique survey data representative of the Dutch electorate, we find clear evidence contradicting this view. Voters strongly support policy experimentation and, in line with theory, particularly so when they do not hold a strong opinion about the policy. In a subsequent survey experiment among Dutch politicians, we find that politicians conform their expressed opinion about policy experiments to what we tell them the actual opinion of voters is.

Comparing different groups of couples allows us to test hypotheses related to three types of within-couple differences that are difficult to disentangle when studying only heterosexual biological parents: relative earnings, childbearing, and gender.

As a solution, synthetic data has been studied and proposed to be a promising alternative to this issue. However, generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic personal health data retains challenges such as simulating the characteristics of the patients’ data that are in the minority classes, capturing the relations among variables in imbalanced data and transferring them to the synthetic data, and preserving individual patients’ privacy. In this paper, we propose a differentially private conditional Generative Adversarial Network model (DP-CGANS) consisting of data transformation, sampling, conditioning, and network training to generate realistic and privacy-preserving personal data. Our model distinguishes categorical and continuous variables and transforms them into latent space separately for better training performance. We tackle the unique challenges of generating synthetic patient data due to the special data characteristics of personal health data. For example, patients with a certain disease are typically the minority in the dataset and the relations among variables are crucial to be observed. Our model is structured with a conditional vector as an additional input to present the minority class in the imbalanced data and maximally capture the dependency between variables. Moreover, we inject statistical noise into the gradients in the networking training process of DP-CGANS to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively evaluate our model with state-of-the-art generative models on personal socio-economic datasets and real-world personal health datasets in terms of statistical similarity, machine learning performance, and privacy measurement. We demonstrate that our model outperforms other comparable models, especially in capturing the dependence between variables. Finally, we present the balance between data utility and privacy in synthetic data generation considering the different data structures and characteristics of real-world personal health data such as imbalanced classes, abnormal distributions, and data sparsity.","2023-06-01","2023-06-06 06:56:58","2023-06-06 06:57:22","2023-06-06 06:56:58","104404","","","","","Journal of Biomedical Informatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-06-06]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\SBQN2DLI\S1532046423001259.html","","Roadmap (Distributed analytics)","Data privacy; Generative adversarial network; Health data sharing; Synthetic data; Synthetic health data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background Most research has studied contributions at the household level, rarely focusing on stepparents' direct contributions. Including various stepfamily structures (e.g., stepfamilies with joint physical custody), we examine the role of gender and postdivorce family structure for stepparents' contributions. Method Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted using the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, large-scale data collected among divorced and separated parents with minor children (2015/2016). Reports of respondents with a new partner about this stepparent's financial contributions to a specific focal child were analyzed (N = 1,439). Results Stepparents' contributions were infrequent, but a sizable minority contributed very often. Stepparents contributed more often when married, when the focal child was coresident, and when the other biological parent of the focal child was repartnered with new biological children, but less often when stepparents had children from a prior relationship. Conclusion Contributions depend on the strength of ties within stepfamilies—as with coresidence and marriage—and to what extent existing biological ties compete with stepparent–child relationships. Implications To better understand the dynamics of contributions, we should also consider the composition of biological ties surrounding stepparent–child relationships.","2023","2023-07-03 14:18:50","2023-07-03 14:23:49","2023-07-03 14:18:50","1-17","","","","","","Financial contributions to stepchildren","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-07-03] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fare.12922","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\DFYUB5FY\Arat and Poortman - Financial contributions to stepchildren The role .pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\KPQXUR7R\fare.html","","Core (MAD 2020); CBS nummer: 8639","childhood; family economics; family structure; financial contributions; stepfamilies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classically, scholars focus on two strategies of informal caregivers to adapt employment: stopping to work and reducing working hours. Two other plausible, but neglected, strategies may similarly have career consequences, namely changing jobs and becoming self-employed. First, we empirically assess whether experiencing a work-care conflict is a condition for choosing a work adaption strategy. Second, we theoretically and empirically take a life course (age at start of caregiving episode) and gender perspective on strategies to adapt paid work. We use detailed retrospective data on informal caregiving in the Netherlands (N = 3,673 caregiving episodes of 2,112 caregivers). Applying multilevel logistic regression analysis, we find that caregivers who felt that they had difficulties combining work and care, were more likely to choose any strategy. Especially caregivers who started to provide care at a young age (24 years or younger) were likely to reduce working hours or change jobs. When starting care in the early family formation stage (25–34 years), women were more likely to reduce working hours, whereas men were more likely to stop working in early middle age (45–54 years).","2023","2023-10-13 14:43:51","2023-10-13 14:43:59","2023-10-13 14:43:51","1-28","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-10-13] Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2023.2207108","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\25IFZP5Q\Raiber et al. - 2023 - Strategies of informal caregivers to adapt paid wo.pdf","","Core (LISS 2019)","labour force participation; life course; work-family; family care; Gender","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, variables which could play a role in inequality of opportunity are often studied separately from each other. Therefore, this retrospective cohort study conducts an innovative intersectional analysis of the inequality of opportunity in admissions to selective HE programs. Using a combination of multivariable logistic regression analyses and descriptive statistics, we aimed to investigate 1) the representativeness of student populations of selective HE programs, as compared to both the applicant pool and the demographics of the age cohort; 2) the demographic background variables which are associated with an applicant’s odds of admission; and 3) the intersectional acceptance rates of applicants with all, some or none of the background characteristics positively associated with odds of admission. The study focused on all selective HE programs (n = 96) in The Netherlands in 2019 and 2020, using Studielink applicant data (N = 85,839) and Statistics Netherlands microdata of ten background characteristics. The results show that student diversity in selective HE programs is limited, partly due to the widespread inequality of opportunity in the selection procedures, and partly due to self-selection. Out of all ten variables, migration background was most often (negatively) associated with the odds of receiving an offer of admission. The intersectional analyses provide detailed insight into how (dis)advantage has different effects for different groups. We therefore recommend the implementation of equitable admissions procedures which take intersectionality into account.","2023-10-13","2023-10-17 07:22:28","2023-10-17 07:22:40","2023-10-17 07:22:28","e0292805","","10","18","","PLOS ONE","Inequality of opportunity in selection procedures limits diversity in higher education","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-10-17] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\LVU5PJ84\Mulder et al. - 2023 - Inequality of opportunity in selection procedures .pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2022)","Netherlands; Professions; Schools; Allied health care professionals; Computer software; Health education and awareness; Regression analysis; Social welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated which demographic characteristics of bachelor students of medicine (BSM) are associated with becoming a physician and (particular type of) medical specialist; and whether this suggests ‘cloning’ (reproduction of sameness) of the existing workforce. Methods We used a retrospective cohort design, based on Statistics Netherlands data of all first-year BSM in 2002–2004 in The Netherlands (N = 4503). We used logistic regression to analyze the impact of sex, migration background, urbanity of residence, parental income and assets categories, and having healthcare professional parents, on being registered as physician or medical specialist in 2021. We compared our results to the national pool of physicians (N = 76,845) and medical specialists (N = 49,956) to identify cloning patterns based on Essed’s cultural cloning theory. Findings Female students had higher odds of becoming a physician (OR 1.87 [1.53–2.28], p < 0.001). Physicians with a migration background other than Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Dutch Caribbean or Indonesian (TMSDI) had lower odds of becoming a specialist (OR 0.55 [0.43–0.71], p < 0.001).

The results show that higher work pressure is reported during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, particularly among managers and professionals and white-collar workers. Occupational differences are also found in the probability of having difficulty combining work and care during the pandemic, with managers and professionals most likely to report having difficulty.

Objective To assess how exposure to green space, blue space, noise, air pollution, and crowdedness along people's daily mobility paths are associated with anxiety symptoms. Methods 358 participants were cross-sectionally tracked with Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled mobile phones. Anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. Green space, blue space, noise, and air pollution were assessed based on concentric buffers of 50 m and 100 m around each GPS point. Crowdedness was measured by the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices detected along the mobility paths. Multiple linear regressions with full covariate adjustment were fitted to examine anxiety-environmental exposures associations. Random forest models were applied to explore possible nonlinear associations and exposure interactions. Results Regression results showed null linear associations between GAD-7 scores and environmental exposures. Random forest models indicated that GAD-7-environment associations varied nonlinearly with exposure levels. We found a negative association between green space and GAD-7 scores only for participants with moderate green space exposure. We observed a positive association between GAD-7 scores and noise levels above 60 dB and air pollution concentrations above 17.2 μg m−3. Crowdedness was positively associated with GAD-7 scores, but exposure-response functions flattened out with pronounced crowdedness of >7.5. Blue space tended to be positively associated with GAD-7 scores. Random forest models ranked environmental exposures as more important to explain GAD-7 scores than linear models. Conclusions Our findings indicate possible nonlinear associations between mobility-based environmental exposures and anxiety symptoms.

Mothers whose partner worked in an essential occupation experienced a relative increase in childcare tasks. Time availability also mattered; primarily for fathers. Working from home was associated with a relative increase in father's involvement in childcare, whereas an increase in work hours was associated with a decrease. Unemployment affected mothers only and was associated with an increase in relative childcare. Conclusion Having an essential occupation potentially functioned as a new resource for some mothers to bargain for more gender-egalitarian divisions of care but also reaffirmed the relative importance of men's paid employment over that of women's in shaping divisions of care. Time availability played a role in divisions of care during the pandemic, but mostly for fathers. Implications The findings extend traditional resources and time availability theories to explain pandemic-based gender differences in the division of care across the pandemic.","2023","2023-11-28 07:54:05","2023-11-28 07:55:55","2023-11-28 07:54:05","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-11-28] _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jomf.12950","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\XVJ9D4HG\André et al. - Extending theoretical explanations for gendered di.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\8Y6PV8Y9\jomf.html","","Core (LISS 2020 Corona)","gender; absolute resources; division of care; essential occupations; parents; relative resources; time availability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a significant portion of this data remains confidential or restricted due to its sensitive nature, such as patient data or census microdata. While maintaining confidentiality prohibits its public release, the emergence of portals supporting rich metadata can help enable researchers to at least discover the existence of restricted access data, empowering them to assess the suitability of the data before requesting access. Existing standards, such as CSV on the Web and RDF Data Cube, have been adopted to facilitate data management, integration, and re-use of data on the Web. However, the current landscape still lacks adequate standards not only to effectively describe restricted access data while preserving confidentiality but also to facilitate its discovery. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the structural, statistical, and semantic elements of restricted access tabular data, and we explore how such relationship can be formally modeled in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We introduce the DataSet-Variable Ontology (DSV), that by combining CSV on the Web and RDF Data Cube standards, leveraging semantic technologies and Linked Data principles, and introducing variable-level metadata, aims to capture high-quality metadata to support the management and re-use of restricted access data on the Web. As evaluation, we conducted a case study where we applied DSV to four different datasets from different statistical governmental agencies. We employed a set of competency questions to assess the ontology’s ability to support knowledge discovery and data exploration. By describing high-quality metadata, both at the dataset- and variable levels, while maintaining data privacy, this novel ontology facilitates data interoperability, discovery, and re-use and it empowers researchers to manage, integrate, and analyze complex restricted access data sources.","2023-12-05","2023-12-08 09:51:42","2024-03-11 08:57:28","2023-12-08","83–91","","","","","","Advancing data sharing and reusability for restricted access data on the Web","K-CAP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","0 citations (Crossref) [2023-12-08]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\9P6AQDFE\Martorana et al. - 2023 - Advancing data sharing and reusability for restric.pdf","","Roadmap (Portal)","FAIR principles; Privacy-preserving web data; Restricted access data; Semantic Web; Variable-level metadata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment rewards maintaining social relations and structures, and penalizes acquiring infections. We find that disease avoidance dominates networking decisions, despite relatively low penalties for infections; and that participants use more sophisticated strategies than expected (e.g., avoiding susceptible others with infectious neighbors), while they forget to maintain a beneficial network structure. Consequently, we observe low infection numbers, but also deterioration of network positions.

This prevents us from systematically comparing studies, hindering the evaluation and accumulation of knowledge. In this paper, we present two datasets which can be used to study the predictability of fertility outcomes in the Netherlands. One dataset is based on the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey which includes thousands of variables on a wide range of topics, including individual preferences and values. The other is based on the Dutch register data which lacks attitudinal data but includes detailed information about the life courses of millions of Dutch residents. We provide information about the datasets and the samples, and describe the fertility outcome of interest. We also introduce the fertility prediction data challenge PreFer which is based on these datasets and will start in Spring 2024. We outline the ways in which measuring the predictability of fertility outcomes using these datasets and combining their strengths in the data challenge can advance our understanding of fertility behaviour and computational social science.

We apply twin models to Dutch administrative data on the educational performance of 18,384 same-sex and 11,050 opposite-sex twin pairs, enriched with data on the quality of primary schools. Our results show that school quality does not moderate genetic and shared-environmental influences on educational performance once the moderation by SES is considered. We find a gene-environment interplay for school SES: genetic variance decreases with increasing school SES. This school SES effect partly reflects parental SES influences.

We investigate the LLMs ability to classify column headers based on domain-specific topics from a controlled vocabulary. We evaluate our approach by assessing the internal consistency of the LLMs, the inter-machine alignment, and the human-machine agreement for the topic classification task. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e. dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our results suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard for internal consistency as well as LLM-human-alignment. Interestingly, we found that context had no impact on the LLMs performances.

We apply state-­of-­the-­art NSUM methods to measure the extended networks for different ethnic-­majority and minoritized groups, also considering migrant generation differences, in the Netherlands. Results show that group differences in network size reflect first-­generation minority citizens having smaller networks and majority citizens having more ethnically homogeneous networks. More positive out-­group attitudes among the Moroccan– and Turkish–Dutch partly explain why these groups have less homogeneous networks than Dutch majority members.

We performed multilevel analyses using existing data on 7021 primary schools and 1315 secondary schools in the Netherlands from the school years 2010–2011 till 2018–2019. Our outcomes were the final test score from primary education and the average grade of standardized final exams from secondary education. School health promotion was operationalized as having obtained Healthy School (HS) certification. For the test score, 7.17% of the total variation was accounted for by differences at the school level and 4.02% for the average grade. For both outcomes, the percentage of disadvantaged students in a school explained most variation. HS certification did not explain variation, but moderated some associations. We found small to moderate differences between schools regarding educational performance. Compositional differences of school populations, especially socioeconomic status, seemed more important in explaining variation in educational performance than general school characteristics and HS certification. Some associations were moderated by HS certification, but differences remained small in most cases.","2024-06","2024-06-17 11:53:34","2024-07-01 06:45:40","2024-06-17 11:53:32","767","","6","21","","","Does School Health Promotion Have Additional Value for Educational Performance?","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-07-01] Number: 6 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\NB7L4Y8F\Vonk et al. - 2024 - Does School Health Promotion Have Additional Value.pdf","","Roadmap (MAD 2020)","educational performance; multilevel analysis; school health promotion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that this provides a unique setting to assess the relevance of partner?s gender for labor market behavior. Using two-way fixed effects and fixed-effects individual slopes models, we find that both men and women tend to work more hours when partnered with a female partner compared to a male partner. These results align with our hypothesis that a partner?s gender influences labor market behavior. For women, we conclude that this finding may be (partly) explained by marital and motherhood status. Additionally, we discovered that women decrease their hours worked to a lesser extent when caring for a child if they have a female partner.

In an original, pre-registered, population-based survey experiment conducted with members of a panel representative of the Dutch population, respondents were assigned randomly to a control group or a treatment: a professionally produced information video mimicking EU communications.

In this opinion, Erik-Jan van Kesteren, head of the ODISSEI Social Data Science team, argues that in order to progress towards widespread adoption of synthetic data as a privacy enhancing technology, the data science research community should shift focus away from developing better synthesis methods: instead, it should develop accessible tools, educate peers, and publish small-scale case studies.","2024-04-26","2024-05-01 07:16:45","2024-05-01 07:20:39","2024-05-01 07:16:45","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2404.17271 [cs, stat]","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\UBBRR4VB\van Kesteren - 2024 - To democratize research with sensitive data, we sh.pdf","","Roadmap (SODA)","Computer Science - Computers and Society; Statistics - Other Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2404.17271","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period. Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.","2024-04-11","2024-04-18 07:45:12","2024-04-18 07:50:33","2024-04-18 07:45:12","","","","","","","The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2404.08098 [physics]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\8PXXV724\2404.html; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\GAMVWR3T\Garcia-Bernardo et al. - 2024 - The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-.pdf","","Roadmap 2020 (CBS)","Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; Physics - Physics and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2404.08098","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data donation offers an innovative and ethical approach to collect these digital trace data. In data donation studies, participants request a copy of the digital trace data a data controller (e.g., large digital social media or video platforms) collected about them. The European Union’s General Data Protec- tion Regulation obliges platforms to provide such a copy. Next, the participant can choose to share (part of) this data copy with the researcher. This way, the researcher can obtain the digital trace data of interest with active consent of the participant. Setting up a data donation study involves several steps and consid- erations. If executed poorly, these steps might threaten a study’s quality. In this paper, we introduce a workflow for setting up a robust data donation study. This workflow is based on error sources identified in the Total Error Framework for data donation by Boeschoten et al. (2022) as well as on experiences in earlier data donation studies by the authors. The workflow is discussed in detail and linked to challenges and considerations for each step.

Results reveal that workers in professional and managerial positions realize larger wage growth than workers who work initially in lower-status occupations. After six years of staying at the same organization, predicted wage growth rates vary between 5.44% for production workers and 10.18% for technical professionals. The findings indicate that occupations compound present and future wage advantages at the organizational level. I test whether occupational sorting across organizations with differing pay quality mediates part of the occupation-based heterogeneity in wage growth.

Each survey systematically examines exposure to potential traumatic events in the past 12 months, including time of event and amount of stress during the event. Furthermore, each survey assesses anxiety and depression symptomatology, lack of social support, physical, mental, work, partner/family, religious, legal, administrative and financial problems, and problem-related services use. Among the by potentially traumatic events (PTEs) affected respondents, current PTSD-symptomatology, social acknowledgement, events-related contacts with various professional, and coping self-efficacy related to the (most stressful) PTE in the past 12 months was examined. This multi-wave study is conducted using the Dutch Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences panel (LISS panel) that is based on a large traditional probability sample of the Dutch population (16+). People cannot register themselves as a panel member which minimizes the risks of selection bias. Panel members receive a financial compensation for each completed questionnaire, which has a positive effect on the response rate. Households that would otherwise be unable to participate are provided with a simple, remotely managed computer and internet connection. The set-up of the LISS panel in 2007 was funded by the Dutch Research Council and is managed by Centerdata, a non-profit institute housed at the campus of Tilburg University (The Netherlands). The number of invited (adult) panel members for the VICTIM-study varies between 6,119 and 7,096 across the years, and the response rate varies between 82.4% and 87.9%. The data of the VICTIMS-study can efficiently be linked with archived data of all other (past or future) studies conducted with the LISS panel, such as the annual Core studies on Health and Personality, and the 300+ Assembled studies conducted with the LISS panel.

The objective of this paper is to study differences between men and women in work location, the relative division of childcare, and perceived work-life balance across and throughout different phases of the pandemic using six waves of probability-based survey data collected in the Netherlands between April 2020 and April 2022 (including retrospective pre-pandemic measures). Method The study used descriptive methods (longitudinal crosstabulations) and multivariate modelling (cross-sectional multinomial logits, with and without moderators) in a repeated cross-sectional design. Results Results suggest the pandemic is associated with several phase-specific differences between men and women in where they worked and their relative division of childcare in the Netherlands. Men were less likely than women to work fully from home at the start of each lockdown and to work on location during the first lockdown. Amongst parents, fathers increased their share of childcare throughout the first phase of the pandemic, and this increase remains visible at the end of the pandemic. Women in the Netherlands did not experience worse work-life balance than men throughout the pandemic, but mothers did experience worse work-life balance than fathers at various points during the pandemic. Discussion Our results suggest varying long-term implications for gender inequality in society. Gender differences in work location raise concerns about the possible longer-term impact on gender inequalities in career development. Our findings on childcare suggest that many households have experienced different divisions of childcare at different stages of the pandemic, with some potential for longer-term change. Conclusion Inequalities between men and women in work, childcare, and wellbeing have neither been alleviated by nor unilaterally worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.","2024-06-25","2024-07-01 07:05:15","2024-07-01 09:53:09","2024-07-01 07:05:13","e0302633","","6","19","","PLOS ONE","Gender inequality in work location, childcare and work-life balance","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-07-01] Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","Roadmap (LISS 2020)","Children; COVID 19; Mothers; Pandemics; Professions; Schools; Sexual and gender issues; Fathers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the view of the general population, survey data were collected from 2407 people representative of the Dutch population. The results indicate that for non-commercial institutions, especially hospitals (97.4 per cent), respondents agree with the retrospective use of imaging data, although they generally indicate that their explicit consent is required. However, most respondents (63.5 per cent) would never allow commercial firms to retrospectively use their imaging data. When including only respondents who completed the minimally required reading time of 12.3 s to understand the description about retrospective radiology research given in the survey (n = 770), almost all (98.9 per cent) mentioned to have no objections for their imaging data to be used by hospitals for retrospective research, with 57.9 per cent indicating their consent to be required and 41.0 per cent indicating that explicit patient consent to be unnecessary. We conclude that the general population permits retrospective radiology research by hospitals, and a substantial proportion indicates explicit patient consent to be unnecessary when understanding what retrospective radiology research entails. However, the general population’s support for the unrestricted retrospective use of imaging data for research purposes without patient consent decreases for universities not linked to hospitals, other non-commercial institutions, government agencies, and particularly commercial firms.","2024-08-19","2024-08-22 06:46:26","2024-09-10 12:45:07","2024-08-22 06:46:24","","","","","","Bioethical Inquiry","Retrospective Radiology Research","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-09-10]","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\3VISP9DB\Ongena et al. - 2024 - Retrospective Radiology Research Do We Need Infor.pdf","","(LISS, 2021); Roadmap (LISS 2021)","Ethics; Informed consent; Medical Ethics; Radiology; Retrospective studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Schools worldwide implement health promotion programs to address these issues and to support the physical and psychosocial health of children. However, more insight is needed into the relation between these health-promoting programs and the Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score and psychosocial health of children, while taking into account how school factors might influence this relation. Therefore, we examined whether the variation between primary schools regarding the BMI z-score and psychosocial health of students could be explained by school health promotion, operationalized as Healthy School (HS) certification, general school characteristics, and the school population; we also examined to what extent the characteristics interact. The current study had a repeated cross-sectional design. Multilevel analyses were performed to calculate the variation between schools, and to examine the association between HS certification and our outcomes. Existing data of multiple school years on 1698 schools were used for the BMI z-score and on 841 schools for psychosocial health. The school level explained 2.41% of the variation in the BMI z-score and 2.45% of the variation in psychosocial health, and differences were mostly explained by parental socioeconomic status. Additionally, HS certification was associated with slightly lower BMI z-scores, but not with psychosocial health.

Consequently, we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network. To overcome this knowledge gap, we employ the innovative approach of data donation by respondents of a high-quality probability-based panel in the Netherlands (the LISS panel) to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a national probability sample. We find that the degree distribution of contacts is best approximated by a log-normal distribution, while the distribution of group membership is best approximated by the exponential distribution. At the individual level, we find that predictors of degree derived from the literature on extended networks mostly replicate.","","2024-11-04 08:41:56","2024-11-04 08:44:35","2024-11-04 08:41:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\5HPLM2DY\scholar_url.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wage decompositions indicate that, between 2006 and 2019, essential workers earned less compared to other workers within higher-paid strata, while they earned more within lower-paid strata of the occupational structure in the Netherlands. These wage diﬀerentials are shaped by sex composition and sectoral employment. In addition, I employ a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences design based on quarterly data between 2017 and 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic reduced an existing average wage gap in response to an increasing public appre- ciation of essential work.

However, people differ in their personality trait trajectories after experiencing important life events. Although several studies have examined the sources of these individual differences, a replicable set of variables explaining individual differences in the reaction to major life events has yet to be identified. In a systematic literature review (Study 1), we integrated existing evidence on potentially important moderators of event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits (23 studies, Ntotal = 82,374). This review showed that (1) only a limited set of moderators has been linked to individual differences in event-related personality trait changes so far, and (2) that there are vast differences in the methods used to examine these effects across studies, complicating meta-analytical integration. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis (Study 2), generating novel and robust evidence for associations between a broad set of psychological, demographic, event-related, and contextual characteristics and event-related personality trait changes. Across eight large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 90,934, Nobs = 391,024), we found several replicable moderators of event-related personality changes. For example, age and psychological variables such as life satisfaction moderated personality trait changes across datasets. Even though the effect sizes of the moderators were (very) small (bMedian = 0.007, ΔR2Median = 0.16%), the findings of the coordinated data analysis contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of event-related personality change, critical for the advancement of contemporary personality development theories.","","2024-11-08 08:39:41","2024-11-08 08:39:41","2024-11-08 08:34:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\K73FA3MN\scholar_url.html","","coordinated data analysis; individual differences; life events; moderator; personality change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Support availability partly depends on the relationships that bind family members together into a family structure. Researchers increasingly analyze such relational structure through a network rather than a household perspective. We identify two issues with this approach: an inattention to the importance of co-residence for support availability and an assumption that family networks do not overlap. We tackle these issues by conceptualizing families as a network of households interconnected at a population scale. Our approach efficiently captures both co-residence patterns and the intergenerational structure of families up to four degrees of separation from a central household. We illustrate the potential of our approach by constructing the ego-networks of 668,190 households with children ages 0-4 using register data from the Netherlands. Through descriptive analysis we reveal significant heterogeneity in family network characteristics, including size, density, relationship composition, and network overlap. Our approach provides a promising framework for studying family structures beyond traditional household and network perspectives.","","2025-01-03 10:13:02","2025-01-03 10:15:41","2025-01-03 10:13:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\7KGMLCYP\scholar_url.html","","family structure; computation social science; family network; kinship; social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use extensive registry data—including PCR test results and population-level networks—to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020–October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculate the probability of temporally associated infections—i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period. Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household ranged from 22.6–23.2%. Interestingly, a high probability (4.7–7.9%) was found even when family members lived in different households, underscoring the persistent risk of transmission within family networks. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65% for pairs attending the same secondary school. It is worth noting, however, that even small increases in school-related infection probabilities can trigger large-scale outbreaks due to the dense network of interactions in these settings. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60%) and school-level (35%) factors. Only a small proportion (3%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.","2024-12-28","2025-01-03 10:09:08","2025-01-06 12:44:20","2025-01-03 10:09:05","31248","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","0 citations (Crossref) [2025-01-06] Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\MII8QBCP\Garcia-Bernardo et al. - 2024 - Assessing COVID-19 transmission through school and.pdf","","","Epidemiology; Infectious diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It contributes to the methodology of measuring the genetic underpinnings of such traits, and makes an applied contribution by assessing the role that genetics plays in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status.  Chapters 2 and 3 study how the large genetic data sets that are used in genomewide association studies (GWAS) of human behavioral traits are subject to selection bias, because respondents participate in such data sets on a voluntary basis.  In Chapter 2, I highlight how various estimates from a frequently used large-scale biobank (the UK Biobank) may be misleading due to volunteer bias, how this bias can be mitigated with inverse probability weights, and I give suggestions on how the next generation of biobanks could deal with this problem of volunteer bias.  In chapter 3, I use the weights estimated in Chapter 2 to show that the non-representative sampling of genetic data biases GWAS analyses. Correcting for volunteer bias using inverse probability weights generally increases the effect sizes of SNPs, increases heritability estimates and alters gene tissue expression results for various traits investigated.  In chapter 4, I study the impact of the polygenic index (PGI) for educational attainment (EA) on the socioeconomic outcomes of one's children. Studying this causal impact is made possible through a novel link between the Lifelines Cohort Study and Dutch administrative data. I condition on the sum of grandparental PGIs to isolate exogenous variation in a parent's PGI at the conception of this parent. As a result, the estimated effect of the parent's PGI on their children's outcomes can be causally interpreted. I find that the EA PGI of parents influences their children's education, income, and wealth, once these children have reached adulthood. The effects are relatively large, showing a surprisingly high intergenerational persistence of one's EA PGI. I show that this high persistence can be understood because two mechanisms mediate the effect of a parent's PGI on children's socioeconomic outcomes. The first occurs at conception of the child, due to the transmission of genetic material from the parent to the child. The second mechanism is environmentally mediated: the genes of a parent influence the environment in which children grow up. Hence, even genes that are not transmitted to the child impact socioeconomic outcomes of children. This “genetic family environment” effect is especially large for wealth-related outcomes, contributing to the large intergenerational persistence of wealth.","2024-12-14","2024-12-16 06:54:26","2024-12-16 06:54:26","2024-12-16 06:54:26","","","","","","","","","","","","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","","en","","dr.","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","ISBN: 9789036107785 Pages: HFSVN34720250115 DOI: 10.5463/thesis.847","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\PWP4H76Y\Van Alten - 2024 - Genetics, Human Capital Formation and the Intergen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each social phenomenon, scientists have proposed a myriad of theories to explain its working mechanisms. Traditionally, these theories are tested by generating hypotheses, translating them into a statistical model, and assessing the significance of the model?s coefficients. Such an approach, however, often leads to the specification of a large number of (at times contradictory) models, all asserting that they capture the same theory. As things currently stand, there is no framework that allows for a comparison of these models. In this article, we argue that benchmarks can serve as a standard frame of reference that can help to determine which models fit better with empirical observations in a specific context. A benchmark is a standardized validation framework that allows for a direct comparison of the prediction accuracy of various models that address the same research problem.

This prospective study aimed to fill this knowledge gap. For this purpose data was extracted from the population-based LISS-panel. We included adult respondents (Nmales = 1,838, Nfemales = 1892) who participated in three surveys before the pandemic (T1March-2019, T2May-2019, T3November-2019) and in three surveys during the pandemic in 2020 (T4March-2020, T5May-2020, T6november-2020). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine and compare the longitudinal associations between PF at T2May-2019 and moderate-severe anxiety and depressions symptoms (ADS) at T3November-2019, and longitudinal associations between PF at T5May-2020 and ADS at T5November-2020 among males and females. Control variables (pre-existing ADS, lack support, demographics) were retrieved from the T1March-2019 and T4March-2020 surveys, respectively. For the present study we distinguished five levels (very high to very low) of each PF. For both sexes, those with (very) low emotional stability and/or conscientiousness had considerably higher rates of ADS compared to those with very high levels of the same trait. These findings were similar both before and during the pandemic. Moreover, we found no indications that those with a certain level of a PF during the pandemic were more of less at risk for ADS or persistent ADS, than those with the same level of the same PF before the pandemic. Thus, we found no indications that the pandemic affected the impact of personality factors on moderate-severe anxiety and depressions symptoms.","2024-11-21","2024-11-25 15:32:33","2025-01-06 12:44:21","2024-11-25 15:32:27","00332941241300949","","","","","Psychol Rep","The Influence of the Big Five Personality Factors on Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Journals","","0 citations (Crossref) [2025-01-06] Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\ZXHPH2VT\van der Velden et al. - 2024 - The Influence of the Big Five Personality Factors .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings reveal that users' experiences are significantly influenced by their technical skills, educational background, and database awareness. Users with higher technical skills generally have more positive experiences, while those with lower skills face barriers related to platform usability and access methods. The report identifies several critical areas for improvement, including metadata quality, user interface design, and tailored support. Recommendations include enhancing metadata standardization, simplifying access methods, developing customized training programs, and increasing database awareness through academic and professional channels. The study also highlights the importance of integrating user feedback and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to address the diverse needs of SSH researchers.

Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. We find that the unsigned Men\'eame network accurately delineates ideological communities, but negative ties are necessary for detecting extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors. We also show that far-left users are more likely to use negative interactions to engage across ideological lines, while far-right users interact primarily with users similar to themselves.","2025-01-09","2025-01-15 11:53:59","2025-01-15 11:54:00","2025-01-15 11:53:56","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2501.05590 [physics]","Comment: 38 pages","","","","Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; Physics - Physics and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2501.05590","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main research question of this thesis is: ""Which machine learning model performs best in predicting entrepreneurship, using the LISS panel datasets, based on F1-score?"" This question arises from a gap in the literature where few studies compare different machine learning models on the same or another specific dataset. The approach in this thesis stands out by evaluating four models: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Booster (XGBoost), using the LISS panel datasets 'Entrepreneurship 2018' and 'Personality 2018'. The methodology include handling class imbalance through techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), as well as using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretation. The dataset comprises 2,293 respondents with detailed personality and entrepreneurship-related traits. The main findings indicate that the LR model outperforms others with an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.43 for entrepreneurs. Despite attempts to improve performance using SMOTE and RFE, these methods did not significantly enhance results. SHAP analysis revealed 'age' and 'risk aversion' as the most impactful predictors, providing valuable insights for both scientific understanding and practical applications in recruitment and managerial contexts.","","2025-02-11 12:02:36","2025-02-11 12:02:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\7ZM8YCW4\Bens - EVALUATING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR PREDICTING.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While work hours have been linked to health and stress outcomes, part-time work may be used to manage work and care responsibilities and thus potentially reduce stress. We examined this relationship in the Netherlands, where part-time work is very common among women, during the COVID-19 pandemic – a period when stress levels were potentially high(er). Methods Data included 1,220 men and women in the Netherlands aged 24 to 64 years from the COGIS-NL study (Wave 2, June 2020) and other modules of the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences panel. Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses were used to analyse gender differences in perceived stress in relation to weekly work hours (<20 hours, short part-time; 20-34 hours, long part-time; 35 hours or more, full-time). Cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression analyses further tested these associations, and any potential mediation by perceived work-life balance, controlling for age, educational level, family situation, and employment situation. Results Gender differences in stress can be attributed to differential effects of part-time employment on men and women’s perceived stress levels. Long part-time work hours were associated with lower stress levels for women, but not for men, and it was only associated with lower stress levels for mothers with co-resident minor children and not for women without. Perceived work-life balance was independently associated with stress but did not mediate the relationship between work hours and stress. Conclusions Higher stress levels among women are likely attributable to differential effects of part-time work on men and women’s stress levels. Working fewer hours (<35) buffered perceived stress for mothers, but not for fathers or individuals without co-resident minor children. Although perceived work-life balance was associated with perceived stress, it did not influence the relationship of work hours with stress.","","2025-02-07 07:45:00","2025-02-07 07:47:05","2025-02-07 07:44:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\KXXZZPLQ\5-35.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ‘intelligent lockdown’ relied on a combination of restrictive measures and an emphasis on individual responsibility as a means of lessening the spread and health impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality existent prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers. Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, we explore changes in three areas: paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. We find that gender inequality patterns in the division of paid work, care work, and housework continue to exist. Moreover, the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnified some inequalities while others were lessened. We find evidence of increased gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life, yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks.

Control schools are selected through genetic matching based on educational and demographic variables, after which comparative interrupted time series estimate the causal effect. The findings show that, on average, track recommendations in the intervention schools did not structurally increase compared to the control schools.

While numerous solutions and approaches have been introduced, they primarily rely on open data, making them not applicable to restricted access data, such as medical records or government statistics, due to privacy concerns. Restricted data can still be shared through metadata, which ensures confidentiality while supporting data reuse. This paper explores how TUS can be computed on restricted access data using metadata alone. We propose a method that achieves 81% accuracy in unionability and outperforms existing benchmarks in precision and recall. Our results highlight the potential of metadata-driven approaches for integrating restricted data, facilitating secure data discovery in privacy-sensitive domains.

However, there are two key limitations to this body of research, particularly when drawing causal conclusions about theoretical mechanisms. The first is that most research on procedural justice, and particularly using experimental vignettes, has been conducted in countries with similar roots in policing (i.e., Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking countries). The second limitation is that research on procedural justice theory using vignettes often fails to closely assess the mechanisms and potential confounds linking experiences of treatment and subsequent attitudes. The current study aims to address both of these gaps by replicating US experimental vignettes among a representative sample of Dutch residents. Specifically, we field a 3x2x2 between-subjects vignette to assess different components of procedurally just treatment by police on individual attitudes during a traffic stop. We assess causal assumptions using a series of follow-up questions about placebo characteristics, and investigate underlying mechanisms by analysing open-text responses following each police legitimacy item. The results from the current study show that, while procedurally just treatment by police was statistically related to perceptions of encounter-specific police legitimacy, the strength of the causal effect and underlying mechanisms were not so clear. Not only was a key causal assumption violated, indicating that the effect does not run only through the treatment, but respondents suggested that they would comply and trust police in the situation based on broader societal norms and expectations, not necessarily because of police behavior. Methodologically, our study suggests that researchers using experimental vignettes need to pay more attention to causal assumptions. Theoretically, our study shows that those interested in testing procedural justice theory (and criminological theories more broadly) must think critically about identifying and evaluating competing mechanisms in different societal and institutional contexts.","","2025-03-18 07:23:21","2025-03-18 07:26:17","2025-03-18 07:22:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\S57724EI\scholar_url.html","","causal assumptions; experimental vignettes; policing; procedural justice; societal norms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Culture is inherently synesthetic, enriched by all senses within a shared time and space. In an optimal synesthetic setting, people of all abilities can connect meaningfully; when one sense is compromised, other channels can be enhanced to compensate. This is the power of multimodality. Digital technology is increasingly able to capture aspects of multimodality. To document multimodality aspects of cultural practices and products for the long-term remains a challenge. Many artistic products from the performing arts tend to be multimodal, and are often immersive, so only a multimodal repository can offer a platform for this work. To our knowledge there is no single, comprehensive repository with a knowledge base to serve arts and disability. By knowledge base, we mean classifications, taxonomies, or ontologies (in short, knowledge organisation systems). This paper presents innovative ways to develop a knowledge base which capture multimodal features of archived representations of cultural assets, but also indicate various forms how to interact with them including machine-readable description. We will demonstrate how back-end and front-end applications, in a combined effort, can support accessible archiving and data management for complex digital objects born out of artistic practices and make them available for wider audiences.","2025-04-08","2025-04-11 06:47:02","2025-04-11 06:47:02","2025-04-11 06:46:59","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2504.05976 [cs]","Comment: submitted to HCI 2025, session Human-Centred Design for Participation and Inclusion","","","","Computer Science - Digital Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2504.05976","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While some datasets can be openly available, others contain sensitive or personal data that needs to be protected. To allow the sharing of the latter datasets, many trustworthy digital repositories provide options to publish data restricted access. However, detailed standardized information about the access conditions for these restricted access datasets are often lacking from the metadata. Researchers interested in reusing these datasets can thus not judge whether they are eligible to reuse data and under what conditions.   To get a better understanding of how we can increase the transparency of access conditions, this paper aimed to investigate the access conditions and procedures that are commonly applied by depositors within the (Dutch) Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) research community. The results of a survey that was conducted (n=45) indicated that various conditions are applied and while some datasets can have few restrictions, for others reuse is highly restricted. Most respondents limit reuse to research purposes and prohibit commercial use. Some datasets are available for students or teaching, but often with additional requirements. A large majority of respondents required a motivation letter to evaluate before allowing reuse. Notably, respondents often chose ‘it depends’ when asked whether a specific condition was applied, showing a lot of nuances in the conditions and the evaluation of access requests. An important result from our survey was that clear procedures and decision-making guidelines seem to be lacking for many respondents. Requests are often evaluated ad-hoc and through email. Decisions are said to require an evaluation of the quality of the application, yet the evaluation criteria seem to be rarely specified and explicitly communicated at the time of data deposit. Based on the results of the small-scale survey, we conclude with a set of six recommendations directed at researchers and infrastructure providers outlining how information about access conditions and procedures can be made more transparent in the future. This work should be seen as a starting point to improve the Accessibility and Reusability of restricted access datasets in the SSH domain.","2025-04-24","2025-04-28 09:57:04","2025-04-28 09:57:10","2025-04-28 09:57:00","","","1","19","","","Improving the Transparency of Data Access Conditions in the SSH Domain","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2025 Deborah Thorpe, Ricarda Braukmann, Angelica Maineri","","","","ijdc.net","","Number: 1","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\2ZRH8CPV\Thorpe et al. - 2025 - Improving the Transparency of Data Access Conditio.pdf","","","curation; DCC; digital curation; digital preservation; IJDC; International Journal of Digital Curation; preservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key question is not simply whether they matter, but rather for whom and under what conditions. Here, we argue that prediction gaps -- differences in predictive performance between statistical models of varying complexity -- offer a pathway for identifying surprising empirical patterns (i.e., not captured by simpler models) which highlight where theories succeed or fall short. Using population-scale administrative data from the Netherlands, we compare logistic regression, gradient boosting, and graph neural networks to predict university completion using early-life social contexts. Overall, prediction gaps are small, suggesting that previously identified indicators, particularly parental status, capture most measurable variation in educational attainment. However, gaps are larger for girls growing up without fathers -- suggesting that the effects of social context for these groups go beyond simple models in line with sociological theory.

Situated in the research area of Retrieval Augmented Generation, this specific workflow details the creation of local and adaptable chatbots. Based on the tool-suite \textit{EverythingData} at the backend, \textit{GhostWriter} provides an interface that enables querying and ``chatting'' with a collection. Applied iteratively, the workflow supports the information needs of researchers when interacting with a collection of papers, whether it be to gain an overview, to learn more about a specific concept and its context, and helps the researcher ultimately to refine their research question in a controlled way. We demonstrate the workflow for a collection of articles from the \textit{method data analysis} journal published by GESIS -- Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences. We also point to further application areas.","2025-05-16","2025-05-23 12:44:22","2025-05-23 12:44:28","2025-05-23 12:44:22","","","","","","","Chatting with Papers","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2505.11633 [cs]","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to Joint Workshop of the 5th AI + Informetrics (AII) and the 6th Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE)","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\YIL6TCVV\Tykhonov et al. - 2025 - Chatting with Papers A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs.pdf; C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\7RG2BCVH\2505.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Digital Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2505.11633","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AUF6MXVI","journalArticle","","Wang, Shuai","Designing Data Infrastructure Maturity Profiles","","","","","","Data infrastructures (DI) [1], in particular data repositories and portals, are critical in the ecosystem for research data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) [2]. Tools specifically designed for modeling DIs are lacking, complicating the comparison of implementation specifications like persistent identifiers, communication protocols, and authentication services across different infrastructures. Consequently, assessing an infrastructure’s alignment with the FAIR principles and its adherence to other recommended guidelines is difficult without reviewing comprehensive documentation, which is often not accessible to the public. In addition, diverse features were found in DIs with different implementation priorities depending on the types of metadata/data and domain-specific requirements [3]. For example, the PURE3D1 Research Infrastructure has a 3D interface of the object. However, the integration of metadata has not yet been completed. Some metadata of DANS SSH Data Station was collected by the ODISSEI Portal [4] and Google Dataset Search2 but it remains unclear when, how often, and with what selection criteria3. Moreover, ODISSEI Portal’s documentation misses details on how the collected metadata is refined, enriched, and republished. Less studied is software dependency, which encompasses the inherited characteristics arising from utilizing existing software components (e.g., PURE3D uses Voyager4) and platforms (e.g., Dataverse [7] and CKAN5) [3].","","2025-05-22 07:53:52","2025-07-07 19:16:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\angel\Zotero\storage\KSRV9UKI\Wang - Designing Data Infrastructure Maturity Profiles.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
